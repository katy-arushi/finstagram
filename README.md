# Finstagram

My first ever web app! This was made during the [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/) Introduction to Web Development course, and was created and deployed over the course of 6 weeks.

Finstagram is an 'Instagram-like' app that allows users to register, log in, post, edit and delete photos with accompanying captions.

Finstagram is deployed on Heroku and can be found [here](https://intense-citadel-23622.herokuapp.com/).

### Tools and Technologies Used
- Ruby
- Sinatra
- ActiveRecord
- HTML / ERB
- CSS
- Heroku

### Things I learned while making this
- Coding is hard. I did not know what was going on most of the time.
- CSS is fun.
- Apparently you can't make apps by just having a bunch of static HTML pages.
- ActiveRecord makes things easy-peasy.
- Learning new things with instructors makes things somewhat less scary.
- There is no better feeling in the world than deploying and sharing your creation with friends.
